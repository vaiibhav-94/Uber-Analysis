# Uber-Analysis
## Introduction
This data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle.

## Business Understanding
We may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. Have we ever used Uber
or any other cab service for this travel? Did we at any time face the problem of cancellation by
the driver or non-availability of cars?
Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business
of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its
revenue.
As an analyst, we decide to address the problem Uber is facing - driver cancellation and
non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue.

## Business Objectives
The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and
non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your
analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses
of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.
